# ? (Name in Progress)

## Description

I am one guy from Germany and i had an idea with two of my freinds for a School Project, a plant watering system that waters a plant itself, but sometihng was missing so i brainstormed how could you make this better, we already were using a ESP32 so i stuck with that what i had (The two others are not that techy thats why i'm speaking of myself). I wanted to make a Network of somekind where you have one BIG Knoten punkt where you connect you watering system, your Mini "NAS" and so on, and that is **?**, it is you Smart Home Made [open Source][1]. 

## Conclusion

Now You may know about [ESPHome][2] And [Home Assistant][3], i didnt know that something like That existed, but i still wanted to make something that is like that.
I do have Already a small [idea Table](#projects), and i am stil Learning and working on everything but someday i will have an result.
