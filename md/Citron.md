# Citron – Modular Smart Plant Care System

**Citron** is a modular, open-source smart plant care ecosystem designed for flexibility, easy customization, and long-term compatibility. The system is built around several hardware modules, each with a dedicated function, allowing users to mix, match, and expand their setup as needed.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design:**  
  Combine only the module's you need:
  
  - **Citron A:** Central bridge/host (Makes its own wifi, and connects to the Plant nodes)
  - **Citron B:** Plant node (sensors, logic, optional pump control)
  - **Pump Module:** Optional, with integrated water reservoir and water level sensing

- **Flexible Power Options:**  
  Each module supports either battery or mains power, configurable by the user.

- **Automated or Assisted Watering:**  
  Citron B can manage a pump for fully automated watering, or simply monitor and notify.

- **Open Plant Database:**  
  Community-driven, open-source plant care database—freely accessible and extendable.

- **Future-Proof & Extensible:**  
  Designed for long-term compatibility, allowing upgrades and new modules to be added years after initial setup.

## Example Use Cases

- **Home plant care:**  
  Automate watering and monitor soil moisture and water levels for each plant.
- **Educational projects:**  
  Learn about IoT, sensors, and automation with approachable hardware and open software.
- **Community gardening:**  
  Share and improve plant care data, and collaborate on new modules or features.
